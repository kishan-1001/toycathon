# TODO: Fix Blog Posting Issue

## Issue Identified
- The error "Network error. Please try again." was due to the backend server not running initially.
- After starting the backend, errors occurred due to incorrect ObjectId instantiation in the requireAuth middleware (missing 'new' keyword).
- Fixed by changing `mongoose.Types.ObjectId(...)` to `new mongoose.Types.ObjectId(...)`.

## Completed Steps
- [x] Added console logs in backend requireAuth middleware and POST /api/blogs route for debugging userId and request body.
- [x] Added error message display in frontend Blog.jsx form to show posting errors.

## Pending Steps
- [ ] Restart the backend server after the ObjectId fix: Open a terminal, navigate to `toycathon-489417ec6ceb59073f7e5474b596a824a8de1972/backend`, run `npm start`.
- [ ] Ensure MONGO_URI is set in backend/.env file (e.g., MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/toycathon).
- [ ] Start the frontend server: Open another terminal, navigate to `toycathon-489417ec6ceb59073f7e5474b596a824a8de1972/frontend`, run `npm start`.
- [ ] Log in to the app and try posting a blog.
- [ ] Check backend console logs for userId and errors.
- [ ] Check frontend for error message display if posting fails.
- [ ] If userId is undefined or invalid, debug user authentication flow.
- [ ] If database connection fails, fix MONGO_URI.
- [ ] Test successful blog posting and verify it appears in the blog list.
